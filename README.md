# Indian-Flag with HTML and CSS

This repository contains the code to create the Indian national flag using only HTML and CSS. The project is a simple representation of the tricolor with the Ashoka Chakra in the center, designed purely with code.


## Features

- **Pure HTML & CSS:** No images are used; the flag is entirely built using CSS.
- **Scalable Design:** The flag is responsive and maintains its proportions on different screen sizes.
- **Minimalist Code:** Easy to understand and modify the structure of the code.
- **Accurate Proportions:** The design follows the official proportions of the Indian national flag (2:3 ratio).

## File Structure

```plaintext
IndianFlag/
│
├── IndianFlag.html    # Main HTML file
├── IndianFlag.css     # CSS file for styling
└── README.md     # Project documentation
```

- `IndianFlag.html`: Contains the structure and layout of the flag.
- `IndianFlag.css`: Contains the CSS rules to style and proportionally create the Indian flag, including the tricolor stripes and Ashoka Chakra.

## How it Works

- **Top Saffron Band**: A div styled with the color `#FF9933` (Saffron).
- **Middle White Band**: A div styled with the color white and contains a representation of the **Ashoka Chakra** using CSS techniques.
- **Bottom Green Band**: A div styled with the color `#138808` (Green).
- **Ashoka Chakra**: The Ashoka Chakra is created using CSS borders and radial gradients to resemble the 24-spoke wheel.

## How to Use

1. **Customize the Flag**:
   You can modify the `IndianFlag.html` and `IndianFlag.css` files to adjust the size or make tweaks to the design if needed.
   
2. **Experiment with CSS**:
   Feel free to experiment with the CSS styles to learn more about how shapes and gradients can be used creatively in web design.
